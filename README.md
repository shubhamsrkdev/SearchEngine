# SearchEngine

SearchEngine is a simple text search engine built using Apache Lucene. This project demonstrates a basic implementation of text indexing and search functionalities using Java and Lucene. It serves as a starting point for building more advanced search applications.

## Overview

This project is a basic text search engine that leverages Apache Lucene for indexing and searching text data. It indexes sample text files (or any other data you provide) and allows you to perform search queries over the indexed content.

## Features

- **Text Indexing:** Automatically indexes text files for fast retrieval.
- **Search Capability:** Supports searching through indexed content using Lucene’s efficient search algorithms.
- **Java-Based:** Built using Java and Maven, making it easy to extend and integrate into other projects.

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or later.
- **Maven:** For building and managing project dependencies.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shubhamsrkdev/SearchEngine.git
   cd SearchEngine
   ```

2. **Build the Project**

   Use Maven to build the project:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

   This command compiles the source code and packages the application into a JAR file.

3. **Data Setup**

   Ensure that you have the necessary text files in the `data` directory for indexing. You can replace or add files in this folder as required by your use case.

## Usage

After building the project, run the search engine using the main class. For example:

```bash
java -cp target/SearchEngine-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.example.Main
```

*Note: Replace `org.example.Main` with the actual fully qualified name of your main class if it differs.*

### How It Works

- **Indexing:** Upon execution, the application reads files from the `data` directory and creates an index using Lucene.
- **Searching:** Once indexing is complete, you can input search queries. The application will return the matching documents based on your query.
